    <description><![CDATA[Hugo 0.48 is built with the brand new Go 1.11. On the technical side this means that Hugo now uses Go Modules for the build. The big new functional thing in Go 1.11 for Hugo is added support for variable overwrites. This means that you can now do this and get the expected result:
{{ $var := &#34;Hugo Page&#34; }} {{ if .IsHome }} {{ $var = &#34;Hugo Home&#34; }} {{ end }} Var is {{ $var }} The above may look obvious, but has not been possible until now.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hugo 0.47 is named Hugo Reloaded. It adds minification support for the final rendered output (run hugo --minify), but it is mostly a bug fix release. And most notably, it fixes a set of issues with live-reloading/partial rebuilds when running hugo server. Working with bundles should now be a more pleasant experience, to pick one example.
This release represents 35 contributions by 6 contributors to the main Hugo code base. @bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @satotake, @anthonyfok, and @coliff for their ongoing contributions.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[**Hugo 0.46** is the closing credits to **The Summer of Hugo**. While most people have been relaxing on the beach, Hugo has been really busy: 0.42, June 12, 2018: Theme Composition and Inheritance! 0.43, July 9, 2018: Hugo Pipes! This was followed by some more technical follow-up releases. And today, when July has turned into August, we come with another one. It&rsquo;s not a big release. But with the big interest in Hugo Pipes, we felt that it was important to get this out there sooner rather than later.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hugo 0.45 is the revival of ref, relref and GetPage. @vassudanagunta and @bep have done some great work improving the API and implementation for the helper functions used to get one page. Before this release, the API was a little bit clumsy and the result potentially ambiguous in some situations.
Now you can simply do:
{{ with .Site.GetPage &#34;/blog/my-post.md&#34; }}{{ .Title }}{{ end }} Or to get a section page:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hugo 0.44 is the follow-up release, or The Sequel, of the very well received 0.43 only days ago. That release added Hugo Pipes, with SCSS/SASS support, assets bundling and minification, ad-hoc image processing and much more.
This is mostly a bug-fix release, but it also includes several important improvements.
Many complained that their SVG images vanished when browsed from the hugo server. With Hugo Pipes MIME types suddenly got really important, but Hugo&rsquo;s use of Suffix was ambiguous.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hugo `0.43` adds a powerful and very simple to use **Assets Pipeline** with **SASS and SCSS** with source map support, **PostCSS** and **minification** and **fingerprinting** and **Subresource Integrity** and ... much more. Oh, did we mention that you can now do **ad-hoc image processing** and execute text resources as Go templates? An example pipeline:
{{ $styles := resources.Get &#34;scss/main.scss&#34; | toCSS | postCSS | minify | fingerprint }} &lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;{{ $styles.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Netlify recently announced support for HTTP/2 server push, and we have now added it to the gohugo.io sites for the main CSS and JS bundles, along with server-side 301 redirect support.
If you navigate to https://gohugo.io and look in the Chrome developer network console, you should now see Push as the new source (&ldquo;Initiator&rdquo;) for the CSS and JSS:
Setting up this in Hugo was easy:
1. Configure Netlify Output Formats Add a new custom media type and two new output formats to config.]]></description>
