      <title>This One Goes to 11!</title>

      <description>Hugo 0.48 is built with the brand new Go 1.11. On the technical side this means that Hugo now uses Go Modules for the build. The big new functional thing in Go 1.11 for Hugo is added support for variable overwrites. This means that you can now do this and get the expected result:
{{ $var := &amp;#34;Hugo Page&amp;#34; }} {{ if .IsHome }} {{ $var = &amp;#34;Hugo Home&amp;#34; }} {{ end }} Var is {{ $var }} The above may look obvious, but has not been possible until now.</description>

      <title>Output Minification, Live-Reload Fixes and More</title>
      <link>https:zyqi17.github.io/2018/0.47-relnotes/</link>

      <description>Hugo 0.47 is named Hugo Reloaded. It adds minification support for the final rendered output (run hugo --minify), but it is mostly a bug fix release. And most notably, it fixes a set of issues with live-reloading/partial rebuilds when running hugo server. Working with bundles should now be a more pleasant experience, to pick one example.
This release represents 35 contributions by 6 contributors to the main Hugo code base. @bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @satotake, @anthonyfok, and @coliff for their ongoing contributions.</description>

      <title>The Summer of Hugo</title>
      <link>https:zyqi17.github.io/2018/0.46-relnotes/</link>

      <description>**Hugo 0.46** is the closing credits to **The Summer of Hugo**. While most people have been relaxing on the beach, Hugo has been really busy:   0.42, June 12, 2018: Theme Composition and Inheritance! 0.43, July 9, 2018: Hugo Pipes!  This was followed by some more technical follow-up releases. And today, when July has turned into August, we come with another one. It&amp;rsquo;s not a big release. But with the big interest in Hugo Pipes, we felt that it was important to get this out there sooner rather than later.</description>

      <title>Hugo 0.45: Revival of ref, relref and GetPage</title>
      <link>https:zyqi17.github.io/2018/0.45-relnotes/</link>

      <description>Hugo 0.45 is the revival of ref, relref and GetPage. @vassudanagunta and @bep have done some great work improving the API and implementation for the helper functions used to get one page. Before this release, the API was a little bit clumsy and the result potentially ambiguous in some situations.
Now you can simply do:
{{ with .Site.GetPage &amp;#34;/blog/my-post.md&amp;#34; }}{{ .Title }}{{ end }} Or to get a section page:</description>

      <title>Hugo 0.44: Friday the 13th Edition</title>
      <link>https:zyqi17.github.io/2018/0.44-relnotes/</link>

      <guid>https:zyqi17.github.io/2018/0.44-relnotes/</guid>
      <description>Hugo 0.44 is the follow-up release, or The Sequel, of the very well received 0.43 only days ago. That release added Hugo Pipes, with SCSS/SASS support, assets bundling and minification, ad-hoc image processing and much more.
This is mostly a bug-fix release, but it also includes several important improvements.
Many complained that their SVG images vanished when browsed from the hugo server. With Hugo Pipes MIME types suddenly got really important, but Hugo&amp;rsquo;s use of Suffix was ambiguous.</description>

      <title>And Now: Hugo Pipes!</title>

      <description>Hugo `0.43` adds a powerful and very simple to use **Assets Pipeline** with **SASS and SCSS** with source map support, **PostCSS** and **minification** and **fingerprinting** and **Subresource Integrity** and ... much more. Oh, did we mention that you can now do **ad-hoc image processing** and execute text resources as Go templates?  An example pipeline:
{{ $styles := resources.Get &amp;#34;scss/main.scss&amp;#34; | toCSS | postCSS | minify | fingerprint }} &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;#34;stylesheet&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;{{ $styles.</description>
