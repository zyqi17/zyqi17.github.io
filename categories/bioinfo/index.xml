      <description>High-throughput (HTP) plant phenotyping approaches are developing rapidly and are already helping to bridge the genotype–phenotype gap. However, technologies should be developed beyond current physico-spectral evaluations to extend our analytical capacities to the subcellular level. Metabolites define and determine many key physiological and agronomic features in plants and an ability to integrate a metabolomics approach within current HTP phenotyping platforms has huge potential for added value. While key challenges remain on several fronts, novel technological innovations are upcoming yet under-exploited in a phenotyping context.</description>
