Inside the four walls of that room lay the immense delta of the Magdalena river, the grey frothy sea of Colombia’s Caribbean coast, the suffocating swamps of the Ciénaga, the interminable geometries of the banana plantations, and a long railway line that ran into the farthest territories of his heart. It ended at the village of Aracataca, now renamed by him Macondo, where his maternal grandparents had brought him up amid prospectors, fornicators, gypsies, scoundrels and virginal girls bent over their sewing frames. In that room where he had locked himself away he inhaled the sweet milk-candy and oregano of his grandmother and absorbed again the political venting of his grandfather, who had fought on the Liberal side in the War of a Thousand Days and who, at the book’s beginning, took him to discover ice, a great block of infinite internal needles that boiled his hand when he touched it.

那间屋子的方寸间却有大天地：马格达莱纳河巨大的三角洲，哥伦比亚加勒比海沿岸灰色的泡沫海，谢纳加令人窒息的沼泽地，连绵不绝排列整齐的香蕉种植地，还有一条长长的铁路，一直通往他的心之最远处。铁路的终点是阿拉卡塔卡小镇（也就是小说中的马孔多镇）。他的外祖父母在那里抚养他长大，身边都是探矿工、通奸犯、吉普赛人、恶棍和埋头织布的纯真少女。他把自己锁在房间里，鼻翼间充斥着外婆的牛奶糖和牛至熟悉的甜香，耳畔再次响起外公谈论政治的声音，他的外公曾在哥伦比亚千日战争中为自由党而战，也是他在《百年孤独》开篇带着主人公去看冰块，那块巨大的物体里面透出无数针芒，手放到上面时感觉仿佛在燃烧。
